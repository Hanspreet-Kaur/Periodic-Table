5. Run the program using the command: `python periodic_table.py`

## Features

### Displaying the Periodic Table

Upon running the program, the periodic table will be displayed in the console. 

### Retrieving Element Details

The program allows you to enter the symbol of an element. After entering an element, the program will retrieve and display the following information:

- Element name
- Element symbol
- Atomic number
- Nature of element

## Dependencies

This program utilizes the following Python libraries:
